## Scope (Where to look for things)

1. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

console.log(window.firstName, window.lastName, window.knownAs);

undefined undefined "no one"
```

2. Guess the output:

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(window.fullName(firstName, lastName));

"AryaStark"
```

3. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var one = addOne(0);
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);


```

4. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(one, two);
```

5. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
fucntion addOne(num){
  return num + 1;
}
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
```

6. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
var one = addOne(0);
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
```

7. Make a Execution Context Diagram for the following JS and write the output.

```js
console.log(addOne(0));
const addOne = num => {
  return num + 1;
};
var two = addOne(1);
console.log(two);
```

8. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  var awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();

undefined
```

9. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  if (true) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();

true
```

10. What will be the output of the following

```js
function isAwesome() {
  let awesome;
  if (false) {
    awesome = true;
  }
  console.log(awesome);
}
isAwesome();

undefined
```

11. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);

"AryaStark"
```

12. What will be the output of the following

```js
let firstName = "Arya";
const lastName = "Stark";
var knownAs = "no one";

function fullName(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
const name = fullName(firstName, lastName);
console.log(name);

"AryaStark"
```

13. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
function sayHello() {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
sayHello();

console.log(name);

name undefined since name is only available inside sayHello function
```

14. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  var name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);
,
"Arya Stark" will be printed in console since in declaration mode, it get var name undefined(since if condition is always true) and in execution mode, assign it value of "Arya Stark". So it will be available in outer environment( outside of if ).
```

15. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
if (true) {
  let name = "Arya Stark";
}
console.log(name);

"Arya Stark" will be printed in console since in declaration mode, it get let name undefined(since if condition is always true) and in execution mode, assign it value of "Arya Stark". So it will be available in outer environment( outside of if ).
```

16. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);

20 as i get hoisted on top because its var.
```

17. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  //
}
console.log(i);
undefined as i is availble inside for loop only not in outer environment. 
```

18. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 100);
}
console.log(i, "second");
20, "second" as it gets updated value of i (And at each stage its not saved individually) and since i is var it get hoisted to top
```

19. Guess the output of the code below with a reason.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i, "first"), 1000);
}
console.log(i, "second");
Error as i is available inside for loop only. 
```

20. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}

undefined as there is only function declaration and console.log() is inside the function and function is never executed. 
```

21. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
  }
  console.log(username);
}

undefined as there is only function declaration
```

22. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  var username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    var username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username);
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}

undefined as there is only function declaration
```

23. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample() {
  let username = "Arya Stark";
  if (true) {
    let username = "John Snow";
    console.log(username, "first");
  }
  console.log(username, "second");
}

undefined as there is only function declaration
```

24. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    let message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}

sample("First", "Second", "Third");

Hello I am First
Hello I am Second
Hello I am Third
As everything seem correct and console.log() have independent outer Lexical Environments, each one has accesst to arguments.
```

25. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function sample(...args) {
  for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
    const message = `Hello I am ${args[i]}`;
    console.log(message);
  }
}

sample("First", "Second", "Third");

Hello I am First
Hello I am Second
Hello I am Third
As everything seem correct and console.log() have independent outer Lexical Environments, each one has accesst to arguments.
```

26. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
if (true) {
  const myFunc = function() {
    console.log(username, "Second");
  };
  console.log(username, "First");
  let username = "Hello World!";
  myFunc();
}

Error as In declaration mode username is saved in memory but its not initialized. So Its undefined in Execution mode inside myFunc function and let declaration comes later after myFunc function declaration. 
```

27. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    console.log(`I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
  inner();
}

outer();

I love this movie called MAD MAX:FURY ROAD will be printed in console and undefined is returned
as the inner function has access to movie variable lexically. 
```

28. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    console.log(`I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}`);
  }
  inner();
}

outer();

I love this movie called BEFORE SUNRISE will be printed in console and undefined is returned
as the inner function first find movie variable in itself only and don't bubble up to find movie
further
```

29. Guess the output and the reason behind that.

```js
function outer() {
  let movie = "Mad Max: Fury Road";
  function inner() {
    let movie = "Before Sunrise";
    function extraInner() {
      let movie = "Gone Girl";
      console.log(`I love this movie called ${movie.toUpperCase()}`);
    }
    extraInner();
  }
  inner();
}

outer();

I love this movie called GONE GIRL
I love this movie called GONE GIRL
extraInner is called twice once just after extraInner() is declared and again when inner() executes. Both time movie variable 
is present in the environment inside extraInner with value "Gone Girl"
```

30. Execute all the functions inside `allFunctions` variable using any loop. (Hint: use for of loop functions are object)

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, sub, multiply, divide];
for(let func of allFunctions) {
    console.log(func(12,10));
}
```

31. You have to pass 10 and 12 as initial value and find the final output when you pass the return value of one function as an input to the next function in the array `allFunctions`.

```js
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const sub = (a, b) => {
  return a - b;
};
const multiply = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const divide = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
};

let allFunctions = [add, add, add, add, add, sub, sub, multiply, divide];
for(let func of allFunctions) {
    console.log(func(12,10));
}
Not sure should I pass one value for next function when we need two values otherwise in last divide is called and if we default second value with 0 it will be undefined. 
```
